the inventor of CART, bagging and random forests

Quotation from
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Breiman}{Wikipedia}

Leo Breiman (January 27, 1928 -- July 5, 2005) was a distinguished
statistician at the University of California, Berkeley. He was the
recipient of numerous honors and awards, and was a member of the United
States National Academy of Science.

Breiman's work helped to bridge the gap between statistics and computer
science, particularly in the field of machine learning. His most
important contributions were his work on classification and regression
trees and ensembles of trees fit to bootstrap samples. Bootstrap
aggregation was given the name bagging by Breiman. Another of Breiman's
ensemble approaches is the random forest.

From
\href{https://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2005/07/07_breiman.shtml}{Breimans
obituary}

BERKELEY -- Leo Breiman, professor emeritus of statistics at the
University of California, Berkeley.

``It is trite to say so, but Leo Breiman was indeed a Renaissance man,
and we shall miss him greatly,'' said Peter Bickel, professor of
statistics and chairman this summer of UC Berkeley's statistics
department.

Breiman retired in 1993, but as a Professor in the Graduate School, he
continued to get substantial National Science Foundation grants and
supervised three Ph.D.~students. Bickel said that some of Breiman's best
work was done after retirement.

``In particular,'' said Bickel, ``he developed one of the most
successful state-of-the-art classification programs, `Random Forest.'
This method was based on a series of new ideas that he developed in
papers during the last seven years, and it is extensively used in
government and industry.''

Breiman's best known work is considered to be ``Classification and
Regression Trees,'' a work in collaboration with three other scholars
that facilitates practical applications, such as the diagnosis of
diseases, from a multitude of symptoms.

(for regression or classification)

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Derive a set of decision rules for segmenting the predictor space into
  a number of regions.
\item
  We classify a new observation into one of these regions by applying
  the derived decision rules.
\item
  Then we typically use the mean (regression problems) or a majority
  vote (classification problems) of the training observations in this
  region as the prediction in the region.
\item
  Key advantage: interpretability.
\end{itemize}

We will only allow \emph{recursive binary partitions} of the predictor
space, using some stopping criterion.

  Classification and regression trees are usually drawn upside down,

\item
  The \emph{terminal nodes} or \emph{leaf nodes} are the nodes at the
  bottom, with no splitting criteria. These represent the final
  predicted class (for classification trees) or predicted response value
  (for regression trees) and are written symbolically as \(R_m\) for
  \(m = 1, 2, ..., M\) - and will be referred to as
  \emph{non-overlapping regions}.

  \emph{Internal nodes} are all nodes between the root and the terminal
  nodes. These nodes correspond to the partitions of the predictor

\subsection{Fitting a regression tree}\label{fitting-a-regression-tree}}

Assume that we have a dataset consisting of \(N\) pairs
\(({\mathbf x}_i,Y_i)\), \(i=1,\ldots,N\), and each predictor is
\({\mathbf x}_i=(x_{i1},x_{i2},...,x_{ip})\).

We want:

\[\hat{f}(X_i)=\sum_{m=1}^M \hat{c}_m I(X_i \in R_m)\] where
\(\hat{c}_m\) is the estimate for region \(R_m\).

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

Two steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Divide the predictor space into non-overlapping regions
  \(R_1,R_2,\ldots,R_m\).
\item
  For every observation that falls into region \(R_j\) we make the same
  prediction - which is the mean of the responses for the training
  observations that fall into \(R_j\).
  \[\hat{c}_m=\text{ave}(y_i \mid x_i \in R_m)\]
\end{enumerate}

How to divide the predictor space into non-overlapping regions
\(R_1,R_2,\ldots,R_m\)?

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

We could try to minimize the MSE (mean squared error, residual sums of
squares) on the training set given by \[
\text{MSE}=\sum_{m=1}^M \sum_{i \in R_m}(y_i-\hat{c}_m)^2,
\] where \(\hat{c}_m\) is the mean response for the training
observations in region \(m\), and is also used as the predicted value
for a new observations that falls into region \(m\).

To do this we need to consider every partition of the predictor space,
and compute the MSE for each partition.

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

Ripley (1996, p 216): Two types of optimality. a) Optimality of the
partitioning of the predictor space : only feasible for small
dimensions. b) Given partitioning of predictor space, how to represent
this by a tree in the best possible way (=minimal expected number of
tests) is a NP-complete problem. (NP=nondeterministic polynomial, a NP
problem can be solved in polynomial time.)

A \emph{greedy} approach is taken (aka top-down) - called
\emph{recursive binary splitting.}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

\hypertarget{recursive-binary-splitting}{%
\subsection{Recursive binary
splitting}\label{recursive-binary-splitting}}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

We start at the top of the tree and divide the predictor space into two
regions, \(R_1\) and \(R_2\) by making a decision rule for one of the
predictors \(x_1, x_2,...,x_p\). If we define the two regions by

\[R_1(j,s)=\{x|x_j\le s\} \text{ and }  R_2(j,s)=\{x|x_j > s\}\]

We need to find the (predictor) \(j\) and (splitting point) \(s\) that
minimize

\[\min_{j,s} [ \min_{c_1}\sum_{i: x_i \in R_1(j,s)}(y_i-c_1)^2+\min_{c_2} \sum_{i: x_i \in R_2(j,s)}(y_i -c_2)^2]\]

For any choice of \(j\) and \(s\) the inner minimization:
\[ \hat{c}_1=\text{ave}(y_i \mid x_i \in R_1(j,s)) \text{ and }
\hat{c}_2=\text{ave}(y_i \mid x_i \in R_2(j,s))\]

This way we get the two first branches in our decision tree.

How costly is this?

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  We repeat the process to make branches further down in the tree.
\item
  For every iteration we let each single split depend on \emph{only one
  of the predictors}, giving us two new branches.
\item
  This is done \emph{successively} and in each step we choose the split
  that gives the best split at that particular step, i.e the split that
  gives the smallest MSE.
\item
  We don't consider splits that further down the tree might give a tree
  with a lower overall MSE.
\end{itemize}

We continue splitting the predictor space until we reach some
\emph{stopping criterion}. For example we stop when a region contains
less than 5 or 10 observations.

What about using as stopping criterion that the reduction in the MSE is
smaller than a specified limit? There is always a possibility that after
a split with little reduction in MSE we might have a split with high
reduction in MSE - leading to suggesting to fit a large tree and then
\emph{prune} down the tree afterwards.

\hypertarget{pruning}{%
\subsection{Pruning}\label{pruning}}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

Imagine that we have a data set with many predictors, and that we fit a
large tree. Then, the number of observations from the training set that
falls into some of the regions \(R_j\) may be small, and we may be
concerned that we have overfitted the training data.

\emph{Pruning} is a technique for solving this problem.

By \emph{pruning} the tree we reduce the size or depth of the decision
tree. When we reduce the number of terminal nodes and regions
\(R_1,...,R_M\), each region will probably contain more observations.

If we have a large dataset with many explanatory variables and terminal
nodes, we can also prune the tree if we want to create a simpler tree
and increase the interpretability of the model, or just avoid
``unneccesary'' splits (for classification that could mean that both
branches give the same classification rule).

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

\hypertarget{cost-complexity-pruning}{%
\subsubsection{Cost complexity pruning}\label{cost-complexity-pruning}}

We first build a large tree \(T_0\) by recursive binary splitting. Then
we try to find a sub-tree \(T\subset T_0\) that (for a given value of
\(\alpha\)) minimizes

\[
C_{\alpha}(T)=Q(T)+\alpha |T|,
\]

where \(Q(T)\) is our cost function, \(|T|\) is the number of terminal
nodes in tree \(T\). The parameter \(\alpha\) is then a parameter
penalizing the number of terminal nodes, ensuring that the tree does not
get too many branches.

We proceed by repeating the the process for a larger value of
\(\alpha\), and this way we get a sequence of smaller of smaller
sub-trees where each tree is the best sub-tree of the previous tree.

For regression trees we choose
\(Q(T)=\sum_{m=1}^{|T|}\sum_{x_i\in R_m}(y_i - \hat{c}_m)^2\), and or
classification trees (to come next) the entropy, Gini or
misclassification rate (the last most popular).

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

Given a value of \(\alpha\) we get a pruned tree (but the same pruned
tree for ``ranges'' of \(\alpha\)). For \(\alpha=0\) we get \(T_0\) and
as \(\alpha\) increases we get smaller and smaller trees.

Technically an algorithm called \emph{weakest link pruning} is used,
where internal nodes in the tree is collapsed to get the smallest
increase pr node for \(Q(T)\). This is done successively until the tree
is a single node tree.

Please study this
\href{https://www.math.ntnu.no/emner/TMA4268/2018v/notes/CART1MA87012017BoLindqvist.pdf}{note
from Bo Lindqvist in MA8701 in 2017} for an example of how we perform
cost complexity pruning in detail. Alternatively, this method, with
proofs, are given in Ripley (1996), Section 7.2.

The consept of pruning is not central in our course, since we will
mostly use trees as building blocks in bagging, random forest and
boosting (where pruning is not ``needed'').

D. Ripley: Fit a Classification or Regression Tree}

Description: A tree is grown by binary recursive partitioning using the
response in the specified formula and choosing splits from the terms of
the right-hand-side.

tree(formula, data, weights, subset, na.action = na.pass, control =
tree.control(nobs, \ldots), method = ``recursive.partition'', split =
c(``deviance'', ``gini''), model = FALSE, x = FALSE, y = TRUE, wts =
TRUE, \ldots)

  Details: A tree is grown by binary recursive partitioning using the
  response in the specified formula and choosing splits from the terms
  of the right-hand-side. Numeric variables are divided into X
  \textless{} a and X \textgreater{} a; the levels of an unordered
  factor are divided into two non-empty groups. The split which
  maximizes the reduction in impurity is chosen, the data set split and
  the process repeated. Splitting continues until the terminal nodes are
  too small or too few to be split.
\item
  A numerical response gives regression while a factor response gives
  classification.
\item
  The default choice for a function to minimize is the deviance, and for
  normal data (as we may assume for regression), the deviance is
  proportional to the MSE. For the interested reader, this is the
  connection between the deviance and the MSE for regression
  \url{https://www.math.ntnu.no/emner/TMA4315/2018h/2MLR.html\#deviance}
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Tree growth is limited to a depth of 31 by the use of integers to
  label nodes.
\item
  Factor predictor variables can have up to 32 levels. This limit is
  imposed for ease of labelling, but since their use in a classification
  tree with three or more levels in a response involves a search over
  2\^{}(k-1) - 1 groupings for k levels, the practical limit is much
  less.

\section{Classification tree}\label{classification-tree}}

There are only minor differences between working with regression and
classification trees.

\hypertarget{fitting-a-classification-tree}{%
\subsection{Fitting a classification
tree}\label{fitting-a-classification-tree}}

Let \(K\) be the number of classes for the response.

Building a decision tree in this setting is similar to building a
regression tree for a quantitative response, but there are two main
differences: \emph{the prediction and the splitting criterion}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

\textbf{1) The prediction:}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In the regression case we use the mean value of the responses in
  \(R_j\) as a prediction for an observation that falls into region
  \(R_m\).
\item
  For the classification case however, we have two possibilities:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Majority vote: Predict that the observation belongs to the most
    commonly occurring class of the training observations in \(R_m\).\\
  \item
    Estimate the probability that an observation \(x_i\) belongs to a
    class \(k\), \(\hat{p}_{mk}(x_i)\), and then classify according to a
    threshold value. This estimated probability is the proportion of
    class \(k\) training observations in region \(R_j\), with \(n_{mk}\)
    observations. Region \(m\) has \(N_m\) observations.
    \[\hat{p}_{mk} = \frac{1}{N_m} \sum_{i:x_i \in R_m} I(y_i = k)=\frac{n_{mk}}{N_m}.\]
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

\textbf{2) The splitting criterion:} We do not use MSE as a splitting
criterion for a qualitative variable. Instead we can use some
\emph{measure of impurity} of the node. For leaf node (region) \(m\) and
class \(k=1,\ldots, K\):

Gini index: \[
G=\sum_{k=1}^K \hat{p}_{mk}(1-\hat{p}_{mk}),
\]

Cross entropy: \[
D=-\sum_{k=1}^K \hat{p}_{mk}\log\hat{p}_{mk}
\] Here \(\hat{p}_{mk}\) is the proportion of training observation in
region \(m\) that are from class \(k\).

Remark: the deviance is a scaled version of the cross entropy.
\(-2\sum_{k=1}^K n_{mk} \log\hat{p}_{mk}\) where
\(\hat{p}_{mk}=\frac{n_{mk}}{N_m}\). Ripley (1996, page 219).

When making a split in our classification tree, we want to minimize the
Gini index or the cross-entropy.

The Gini index can be interpreted as the expected error rate if the
label is chosen randomly from the class distribution of the node.
According to Ripley (1996, page 217) Breiman et al (CART) preferred the
Gini index.

, and subscript \(2\) for the right region.

\hypertarget{why-not-misclassification-rate-as-the-split-criterion}{%
\subsubsection{Why not misclassification rate as the split
criterion?}\label{why-not-misclassification-rate-as-the-split-criterion}}

(ESL page 309)

Data set with 400 controls and 400 cases.

Two possible split points are considered.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\item
  Split A give 400 observations to the left and right, where left node
  has 300 cases 100 controls and right node has 100 cases and 300
  controls. Use majority vote. Misclassification rate=200/800=0.25.
\item
  Split B has 600 observations to the left and 200 to the right. Now the
  left node has 200 cases and 400 controls, while the right node has 200
  cases and 0 controls. Use majority vote to get 200/800=0.25
  misclassification rate.
\end{enumerate}

Which of the splits A or B is the preferable split?

Answer: B- because we then have a \emph{pure} node (only one class).

Gini and cross-entropy would have lower cost for B split than the A
split.

(However, misclassification is the preferred choice for the
cost-complexity pruning of classification trees.)

\hypertarget{classification-example}{%
\subsection{Classification example}\label{classification-example}}

We will use the classical data set of \emph{diabetes} from a population
of women of Pima Indian heritage in the US, available in the R
\texttt{MASS} package. The following information is available for each
woman:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  diabetes: \texttt{0}= not present, \texttt{1}= present
\item
  npreg: number of pregnancies
\item
  glu: plasma glucose concentration in an oral glucose tolerance test
\item
  bp: diastolic blood pressure (mmHg)
\item
  skin: triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
\item
  bmi: body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)\(^2\))
\item
  ped: diabetes pedigree function.
\item
  age: age in years
\end{itemize}

We will use a training set (called \texttt{ctrain}) with 300
observations (200 non-diabetes and 100 diabetes cases) and a test set
(called \texttt{ctest}) with 232 observations (155 non-diabetes and 77
diabetes cases). Our aim is to make a classification rule for diabetes
(or not) based on the available data.

(There is a version of the training data with missing values,
\texttt{Pima.tr2} in the \texttt{MASS} library. Here a slightly
different shuffling for training and test data than in \texttt{MASS} is
used, because these data were used in a project in TMA4268.)

\item
  Use recursive binary splitting to grow a large tree on the training
  data, stopping only when each terminal node has fewer than some
  minimum number of observations.
\item
  Apply cost complexity pruning to the large tree in order to obtain a
  sequence of best sub-trees, as a function of \(\alpha\).
\item
  Use K-fold cross-validation to choose \(\alpha\). That is, divide the
  training observations into K folds. For each k = \(1,\ldots, K\):

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Repeat Steps 1 and 2 on all but the kth fold of the training data.
  \item
    Evaluate the mean squared prediction (misclassification, gini,
    cross-entropy) error on the data in the left-out \(k\)th fold, as a
    function of \(\alpha\).
  \item
    Average the results for each value of \(\alpha\), and pick
    \(\alpha\) to minimize the average error.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Return the sub-tree from Step 2 that corresponds to the chosen value
  of \(\alpha\).

\subsection{Handling missing covariates in
trees}\label{handling-missing-covariates-in-trees}}

Instead of removing observation with missing values, or performing
single or multiple imputation, there are two popular solutions to the
problem for trees:

\textbf{Make a ``missing category''}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If you believe that missing covariates behave in a particular way
  (differently from the non-missing values), we may construct a new
  category for that variable.
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

\textbf{Use surrogate splits}

The best split at a node is called the \emph{primary split}.

An observation with missing value for variable \(x_1\) is dropped down
the tree, and arrive at a split made on \(x_1\).

A ``fake'' tree is built to predict the split, and the observation
follows the predicted direction in the tree. This means that the
correlation between covariates are exploited - and the higher the
correlation between the primary and predicted primary split - the
better.

This is called a \emph{surrogate split}.

If the observation is missing the surrogate variable, there is also a
back-up surrogate variable that can be used (found in a similar
fashion.)

If the surrogate variable is not giving more information than following
the majority of the observations at the primary split, it will not be
regarded as a surrogate variable.

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

The R package \texttt{rpart}
\href{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rpart/vignettes/longintro.pdf}{vignette
page 18} gives the following example:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Assume that the split (age \textless40, age ≥40) has been chosen.
\item
  Surrogate variables are found by \emph{re-applying the partitioning
  algorithm} (without recursion=only one split?) to predict the two
  categories age \textless40 vs.~age ≥40 using the other covariates.
\item
  Using ``number of misclassified''/``number of observations'' as the
  criterion: the optimal split point is found for each covariate.
\item
  A competitor is the majority rule - that is, go in the direction of
  the split where the majority of the training data goes. This is given
  misclassification error min(p, 1 − p) where p = (\# in A with age
  \textless{} 40) / nA.
\item
  A ranking of the surrogate variables is done based on the
  misclassification error for each surrogate variable, and variables
  performing better than the majority rule is kept.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Categorical predictors: For a predictor with \(q\) levels (may be
  unordered) the number of possible partitions into two groups is large.
  A trick is used in the processing, where first dummy variable coding
  is performed then sorted by increasingly popular categories into a
  ordered categorical variable. Proofs exists that this gives optimal
  splits for cross-entropy, Gini, squared loss (see ESL page 310 for
  references).
\item
  Categorical predictors with many levels may have a advantage for the
  splits, because there are so many possible splits that often one is
  very good. This may lead to overfitting if \(q\) is large.
\item
  For multiclass problems loss matrices may be included easily in the
  Gini loss.
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Binary splits: multiway splits into more than two groups is possible,
  but may fragment the data very quickly (too quickly). Multiway splits
  is achived by a series of binary splits. Thus, we stay with binary
  splits.
\item
  Due to the binary splits it may be hard to model an additive
  structure.
\item
  Linear combination splits: is possible by including also finding
  linear weight parameters for the splits. This may improve predictive
  power, but hurt interpretability.
\item
  There exists other tree-building procedures than CART. One such is
  C5.0 by Quinlan, see ESL page 312 for reference.
\item
  For regression trees the regression surface will be non-smooth, which
  may degrade performance. For classification trees where there response
  is a classification (and thus not smooth) this is not a large problem.

\textbf{Advantages (+)} of using trees

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Trees automatically select variables
\item
  Tree-growing algorithms scale well to large \(n\), growing a tree
  greedily
\item
  Trees can handle mixed features (continuouos, categorical) seamlessly,
  and can deal with missing data
\item
  Small trees are easy to interpret and explain to people
\item
  Some believe that decision trees mirror human decision making
\item
  Trees can be displayed graphically
\item
  Trees model non-linear effects
\item
  Trees model interactions between covariates
\item
  Trees handle missing data in a smart way!
\item
  Outliers and irrelevant inputs will not affect the tree.
\end{itemize}

There is no need to specify the functional form of the regression curve
or classification border - this is found by the tree automatically.

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

\textbf{Disadvantages (-)} of using trees

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Large trees are not easy to interpret
\item
  Trees do not generally have good prediction performance (high
  variance)
\item
  Trees are not very robust, a small change in the data may cause a
  large change in the final estimated tree
\item
  Trees do not produce a smooth regression surface.

As the tree size increase the bias will decrease, and the variance will

model complexity.

\section{Bagging}\label{bagging}}

Bagging can be used with different regression and classification
methods, but we will focus on trees.

\hypertarget{high-variance-of-trees}{%
\subsection{High variance of trees}\label{high-variance-of-trees}}

Decision trees often suffer from high variance.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  By this we mean that the trees are sensitive to small changes in the
  predictors:
\item
  If we change the observation set, we may get a very different tree.
\item
  This is due to the fact that small changes in the data can result in a
  large effect on which splits is done.
\item
  A small effect on the top level is propagated down in the tree.
\end{itemize}

For the Boston data, we saw that changing the train/test split gave very
different trees

To reduce the variance of decision trees we can apply \emph{bootstrap
aggregating} (\emph{bagging}), invented by Leo Breiman in 1996 (after he
retired in 1993).

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

\hypertarget{independent-data-sets}{%
\subsection{Independent data sets}\label{independent-data-sets}}

Assume we have \(B\) i.i.d. observations of a random variable \(X\) each
with the same mean and with variance \(\sigma^2\). We calculate the mean
\(\bar{X} = \frac{1}{B} \sum_{b=1}^B X_b\). The variance of the mean is
\[\text{Var}(\bar{X}) = \text{Var}\Big(\frac{1}{B}\sum_{b=1}^B X_b \Big) = \frac{1}{B^2} \sum_{b=1}^B \text{Var}(X_b) = \frac{\sigma^2}{B}.\]
By averaging we get reduced variance. This is the basic idea!

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

But, we will not draw random variables - we want to fit decision trees:
\(\hat{f}_1({\mathbf x}),\hat{f}_2({\mathbf x}),\ldots, \hat{f}_B({\mathbf x})\)
and average those.
\[ \hat{f}_{avg}({\mathbf x})=\frac{1}{B}\sum_{b=1}^B \hat{f}_b({\mathbf x})\]

However, we do not have many independent data set - so we use
\emph{bootstrapping} to construct \(B\) data sets.

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

\hypertarget{bootstrapping}{%
\subsection{Bootstrapping}\label{bootstrapping}}

Problem: we want to draw samples from a population with distribution
\(F\).

But: we do not know \(F\) and do not have a population to draw from, we
only have our one sample.

Solution: we may use our sample as an empirical estimate for the
distribution \(F\) - by assuming that each sample point has probability
\(1/N\) for being drawn.

Therefore: we draw with replacement \(N\) observations from our sample -
and that is our first \emph{bootstrap sample}.

We repeat this \(B\) times and get \(B\) bootstrap samples - that we use
as our \(B\) data sets.

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

\hypertarget{bootstrap-samples-and-trees}{%
\subsection{Bootstrap samples and
trees}\label{bootstrap-samples-and-trees}}

For each bootstrap sample we construct a decision tree,
\(\hat{f}^{*b}(x)\) with \(b=1,...,B\), and we then use information from
all of the trees to draw inference.

Study Figure 8.9 to see variability of trees - observe that different
covariates are present in each tree. All features are equally correlated
\(0.95\). Observe

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  trees variable (high variance)
\item
  bagging will smooth out this variance to reduce the test error

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

\hypertarget{bagging-regression-trees}{%
\subsection{Bagging regression trees}\label{bagging-regression-trees}}

For regression trees, we take the average of all of the predictions and
use this as the final result:

\[
\hat{f}_{bag}(x)=\frac{1}{B}\sum_{b=1}^B \hat{f}^{*b}(x).
\]

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Bagging works well under squared loss.
\item
  It can be shown that true population aggregation never increases the
  MSE (ESL Eq 8.52).
\item
  Thus, we expect a decrease in MSE with bagging.
\item
  However, a ``similar result'' is not true for classification trees.
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

\hypertarget{bagging-classification-trees}{%
\subsection{Bagging classification
trees}\label{bagging-classification-trees}}

For classification trees there are two possible ways to use the tree
ensemble of \(B\) trees:

\textbf{consensus}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  we record the predicted class (for a given observation \(x\)) for each
  of the \(B\) trees and
\item
  use the most occurring classification (majority vote) as the final
  prediction.
\item
  (It is not wise to use the voting proportions to get posterior
  probabilites. For example is P(class 1)=0.75 but all B trees votes for
  1.)
\end{itemize}

Let \(\hat{G}(x)\) be the estimated class, and
\[\hat{G}(x)=\text{argmax}_k q_k(x)\] where \(q_k(x)\) is the proportion
of the trees voting \(k\), \(k=1,\ldots,K\).

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

\textbf{probability}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  alternatively average posterior probabilities for each class
  \(\hat{p_m^b}\),
\item
  and then choose the class with the largest probability.
\end{itemize}

\[\hat{G}(x)=\text{argmax}_k \frac{1}{B} \sum_{b=1}^B p^b_k(x)\] where
\(p^b_k(x)\) is estimated probability for class \(k\) for tree \(b\) at
\(x\).

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

\hypertarget{prediction-by-consensus-vs-probability}{%
\subsubsection{Prediction by consensus vs
probability}\label{prediction-by-consensus-vs-probability}}

Consider the case when you have grown \(B\) classification tree with a
binary response with classes 0 and 1. You might wonder which approach to
choose to make a final prediction: consensus or probability? Or would
the prediction be the same in each case?

The difference between these two procedures can be compared to the
difference between the mean value and median of a set of numbers. If we
average the probabilities and make a classification thereafter, we have
the mean value. If we sort all of our classifications, so that the
classifications corresponding to one class would be lined up after each
other, followed by the classifications corresponding to the other class
we obtain the median value.

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

We examine this by an example:

Suppose we have \(B=5\) (no, \(B\) should be higher - this is only for
illustration) classification tree and have obtained the following 5
estimated probabilities: \{0.4, 0.4, 0.4, 0.4, 0.9 \}. If we average the
probabilities, we get 0.5, and if we use a cut-off value of 0.5, our
predicted class is 1. However, if we take a majority vote, using the
same cut off value, the predicted classes will be \{0, 0, 0, 0, 1 \}.
The predicted class, based on a majority vote, would accordingly be 0.

The two procedures thus have their pros and cons: * By averaging the
predictions no information is lost. We do not only get the final
classification, but the probability for belonging to the class 0 or 1. *
However, this method is not robust to outliers. By taking a majority
vote, outliers have a smaller influence on the result.

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  According to ESL (page 283) the probability method will give bagged
  classifiers with lower variance that with the consensus method.
\item
  Bagging a good classifier can make it better, but bagging a bad
  classifier can make it worse. (Not as for MSE for regression tree.)

  An increase in \(B\) will not lead to overfitting, and \(B\) is not

\item
  If a goodness of fit measure is plotted as a function of \(B\) (soon)
  we see that (given that \(B\) is large enough) increasing \(B\) will
  not change the goodness of fit measure.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  We use a subset of the observations in each bootstrap sample. We know
  that the probability that an observation is in the bootstrap sample is
  approximately \(1-e^{-1}\)=0.6321206 (0.63212).
\item
  when an observation is left out of the bootstrap sample it is not used
  to build the tree, and we can use this observation as a part of a
  ``test set'' to measure the predictive performance and error of the
  fitted model, \(f^{*b}(x)\).
\end{itemize}

In other words: Since each observation \(i\) has a probability of
approximately 2/3 to be in a bootstrap sample, and we make \(B\)
bootstrap samples, then observation \(i\) will be outside the bootstrap
sample in approximately \(B/3\) of the fitted trees.

The observations left out are referred to as the \emph{out-of-bag}
observations, and the measured error of the \(B/3\) predictions is
called the \emph{out-of-bag error}.

\subsection{When should we use
bagging?}\label{when-should-we-use-bagging}}

Bagging can be used for predictors (regression and classification) that
are not trees, and according to Breiman (1996):

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  the vital element is the instability of the prediction method
\item
  if perturbing the learning set can cause significant changes in the
  predictor constructed, then bagging can improve accuracy.
\end{itemize}

Breiman (1996) suggests that these methods should be suitable for
bagging:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  neural nets, classification and regression trees, subset selection in
  linear regression
\end{itemize}

however not nearest neighbours - since

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  the stability of nearest neighbour classification methods with respect
  to perturbations of the data distinguishes them from competitors such
  as trees and neural nets.
\end{itemize}

Would you think that much is gained by bootstrapping MLR, logistic
regression, or a lasso version of the two?

BUT: making many trees destroys the interpretability of the estimator.

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

\hypertarget{random-forest}{%
\section{Random forest}\label{random-forest}}

If there is a strong predictor in the dataset, the decision trees
produced by each of the bootstrap samples in the bagging algorithm
becomes very similar: Most of the trees will use the same strong
predictor in the top split.

\emph{Random forests} is a solution to this problem and a method for
decorrelating the trees. The hope is to improve the variance reduction.

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

\subsection{The effect of correlation on the variance of the
mean}\label{the-effect-of-correlation-on-the-variance-of-the-mean}}

The variance of the average of \(B\) observations of i.i.d random
variables \(X\), each with variance \(\sigma^2\) is
\(\frac{\sigma^2}{B}\). Now, suppose we have \(B\) observations of a
random variable \(X\) which are identically distributed, each with mean
\(\mu\) and variance \(\sigma^2\), but not independent.

That is, suppose the variables have a positive correlation \(\rho\)
\[\text{Cov}(X_i, X_j) = \rho \sigma^2, \quad i \neq j.\] This is called
compound symmetry.

Then the variance of the average is
\[\rho \sigma^2+\frac{1-\rho}{B} \sigma^2\] (Exercise to prove this.)

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

Check: \(\rho=0\) and \(\rho=1\)? Observe the linearity in \(\rho\).

(Most negative values of \(\rho\) will not give a positive definite
covariance matrix. The covariance matrix is positive definite if
\(\rho>-1/(B-1)\).)

\hypertarget{core-modifications-to-bagging}{%
\subsection{Core modifications to
bagging}\label{core-modifications-to-bagging}}

The idea behind random forest is to \emph{improve the variance reduction
of bagging} by reducing the correlation between the trees - while hoping
the possible increase in variance in each tree doesn´t cancel the
improvement.

The procedure is thus as in bagging, but with the important difference,
that

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  at each split we are only allowed to consider \(m<p\) of the
  predictors.
\end{itemize}

A new sample of \(m\) predictors is taken at each split and

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  typically \(m= \text{floor}(\sqrt p)\) (classificaton) and
  \(m=\text{floor}(p/3)\) (regression)
\end{itemize}

The general idea is at for very correlated predictors \(m\) is chosen to
be small.

Study ESL Figure 15.3 to see that the rule of thumb for \(m\) may not
always be the best choice.

Study ESL Figure 15.9 to se that the correlation between trees is
dependent on \(m\).

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

In addition the recommendations from the Random forest authors were also
on \emph{node size} (the minimum number of observations in a leaf node):

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  classification: 1
\item
  regression: 5
\end{itemize}

(ESL page 592)

This is an indication that node size is an hyperparameter, but ESL argue
that is is maybe not worth the extra effort to optimize on this
parameter.

Study ESL Figure 15.8 for effect of node size.

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

The number of trees, \(B\), is not a tuning parameter (according to the
ISLR-authors), and the best is to choose it large enough.

But - in lecture L7 we will hear that we may also look at many of the
choices for how to fit a tree as model hyperparameters - in addition to
both \(B\) and \(m\).

random forest to stabilize), the OOB error estimate is equivalent to
LOOCV (CASI: Efron and Hastie, 2016, p 330).

\subsection{Variable importance plots}\label{variable-importance-plots}}

Bagging is an example of an \emph{ensemble method}, so is boosting and
random forests. For all of these methods many trees are grown and
combined, and the predictive power can be highly improved. However, this
comes at a cost of interpretability. Instead of having one tree, the
resulting model consists of \(B\) trees, where \(B\) often is 300 or 500
(or maybe even 5000 when boosting).

Variable importance plots show \emph{the relative importance of the
predictors:} the predictors are sorted according to their importance,
such that the top variables have a higher importance than the bottom
variables. There are in general two types of variable importance plots:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  variable importance based on decrease in node impurity and
\item
  variable importance based on randomization.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{variable-importance-for-a-single-tree}{%
\subsubsection{Variable importance for a single
tree}\label{variable-importance-for-a-single-tree}}

(10.13.1)

A single tree can be studied to interpret the model fitted. For large
trees - and in the coming chapters - for many trees, the concept of
\emph{variable importance} is useful.

Consider a covariate. How important is this covariate for the tree
prediction?

We have a tree \(T\) with \(J-1\) \emph{internal nodes} (remark: no leaf
nodes - because there is no split at a leaf node).

Let \(I_l^2(T)\) be a measure of squared relevance for predictor
\(X_l\):

\[ I_l^2(T)=\sum_{t=1}^{J-1} \hat{i}^2_t I(v(t)=l)\]

At each internal node \(t\) there is a split, where the covariate to
split on is denoted \(X_{v(t)}\), and this variable was the one that
gave the maximal improvement \(\hat{i}^2_t\).

The importance measure is the square root, so
\(I_l(T)= \sqrt{I_l^2(T)}\).

The term \emph{important} relates to \emph{total decrease in the node
impurity, over splits for a predictor}, and is defined differently for
regression trees and classification trees.

\hypertarget{from-single-to-many-trees}{%
\subsubsection{From single to many
trees}\label{from-single-to-many-trees}}

\[I_l^2=\frac{1}{B} \sum_{b=1}^B I_l^2(T_b)\] The measure is relative:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  the highest value is set to 100
\item
  the others are scaled according to this
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

\textbf{Regression trees:}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The importance of each predictor is calculated using the MSE.
\item
  The algorithm records the total amount that the MSE is decreased due
  to splits for each predictor (there may be many spits for one
  predictor for each tree).
\item
  This decrease in MSE is then averaged over the \(B\) trees. The higher
  the decrease, the more important the predictor.
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

\textbf{Classification trees:}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The importance of each predictor is calculated using the Gini index.
\item
  The importance is the mean decrease (over all \(B\) trees) in the Gini
  index by splits of a predictor.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Variable importance based on
randomization}\label{variable-importance-based-on-randomization}}

Variable importance based on randomization is calculated using the OOB
sample.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Computations are carried out for one bootstrap sample at a time.
\item
  Each time a tree is grown the OOB sample is used to test the
  predictive power of the tree.
\item
  Then for one predictor at a time, repeat the following:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    permute the OOB observations for the \(j\)th variable \(x_j\) and
    calculate the new OOB error.
  \item
    If \(x_j\) is important, permuting its observations will decrease
    the predictive performance.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  The difference between the two is averaged over all trees
\item
  and again highest set to 100, others rescaled.
\end{itemize}
