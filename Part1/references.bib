abstract = {Summary In many supervised learning applications, understanding and visualizing the effects of the predictor variables on the predicted response is of paramount importance. A shortcoming of black box supervised learning models (e.g. complex trees, neural networks, boosted trees, random forests, nearest neighbours, local kernel-weighted methods and support vector regression) in this regard is their lack of interpretability or transparency. Partial dependence plots, which are the most popular approach for visualizing the effects of the predictors with black box supervised learning models, can produce erroneous results if the predictors are strongly correlated, because they require extrapolation of the response at predictor values that are far outside the multivariate envelope of the training data. As an alternative to partial dependence plots, we present a new visualization approach that we term accumulated local effects plots, which do not require this unreliable extrapolation with correlated predictors. Moreover, accumulated local effects plots are far less computationally expensive than partial dependence plots. We also provide an R package ALEPlot as supplementary material to implement our proposed method.},

abstract="Counterfactual explanations are one of the most popular methods to make predictions of black box machine learning models interpretable by providing explanations in the form of `what-if scenarios'. Most current approaches optimize a collapsed, weighted sum of multiple objectives, which are naturally difficult to balance a-priori. We propose the Multi-Objective Counterfactuals (MOC) method, which translates the counterfactual search into a multi-objective optimization problem. Our approach not only returns a diverse set of counterfactuals with different trade-offs between the proposed objectives, but also maintains diversity in feature space. This enables a more detailed post-hoc analysis to facilitate better understanding and also more options for actionable user responses to change the predicted outcome. Our approach is also model-agnostic and works for numerical and categorical input features. We show the usefulness of MOC in concrete cases and compare our approach with state-of-the-art methods for counterfactual explanations.",

abstract = {Despite widespread adoption, machine learning models remain mostly black boxes. Understanding the reasons behind predictions is, however, quite important in assessing trust, which is fundamental if one plans to take action based on a prediction, or when choosing whether to deploy a new model. Such understanding also provides insights into the model, which can be used to transform an untrustworthy model or prediction into a trustworthy one.In this work, we propose LIME, a novel explanation technique that explains the predictions of any classifier in an interpretable and faithful manner, by learning an interpretable model locally varound the prediction. We also propose a method to explain models by presenting representative individual predictions and their explanations in a non-redundant way, framing the task as a submodular optimization problem. We demonstrate the flexibility of these methods by explaining different models for text (e.g. random forests) and image classification (e.g. neural networks). We show the utility of explanations via novel experiments, both simulated and with human subjects, on various scenarios that require trust: deciding if one should trust a prediction, choosing between models, improving an untrustworthy classifier, and identifying why a classifier should not be trusted.},

This challenge becomes more important in the era of big data and complex statistical modeling. The cherry tree (dataset) can be very large and the tools for cherry picking (statistical learning methods) are now very sophisticated.

    abstract = "{Researchers often face the problem of how to address missing data. Multiple imputation is a popular approach, with multiple imputation by chained equations (MICE) being among the most common and flexible methods for execution. MICE iteratively fits a predictive model for each variable with missing values, conditional on other variables in the data. In theory, any imputation model can be used to predict the missing values. However, if the predictive models are incorrectly specified, they may produce biased estimates of the imputed data, yielding inconsistent parameter estimates and invalid inference. Given the set of modeling choices that must be made in conducting multiple imputation, in this paper we propose a data-adaptive approach to model selection. Specifically, we adapt MICE to incorporate an ensemble algorithm, Super Learner, to predict the conditional mean for each missing value, and we also incorporate a local kernel-based estimate of variance. We present a set of simulations indicating that this approach produces final parameter estimates with lower bias and better coverage than other commonly used imputation methods. These results suggest that using a flexible machine learning imputation approach can be useful in settings where data are missing at random, especially when the relationships among the variables are complex.}",
