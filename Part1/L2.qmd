# Plan

Continue with the decision theoretic framework from L1, but now for classification. Bias-variance trade-off.

* Classification - should not be new (ESL Ch 4.1-4.5, except 4.4.4)
* Statistical decision theoretic framework for classification (ESL 2.4)
* and the bias-variance trade-off (ESL 2.9 and 7.2-7.3)


# Statistical decision theoretic framework
(ESL Ch 2.4)

is a mathematical framework for developing models $f$ - and assessing optimality.

Last time, regression:

* $X \in \Re^p$
* $Y \in \Re$
* $P(X,Y)$ joint distribution of covariates and respons

Aim: find a function $f(X)$ for predicting $Y$ from some inputs $X$.

Ingredients: Loss function $L(Y,f(X))$ - for _penalizing errors in the prediction_.

Criterion for choosing $f$: Expected prediction error (EPE)

---

$$ \text{EPE}(f)=\text{E}_{X,Y}[L(Y,f(X))]=\int_{x,y}L(y,f(x))p(x,y)dxdy$$
Choose $f$ to minimize the $\text{EPE}(f)$. 

What changes do we need to do for classifiation?

---

## Classification set-up

* $X \in \Re^p$
* $G \in {\cal G}=\{1,\ldots,K\}$
* $\hat{G}(X) \in {\cal G}=\{1,\ldots,K\}$ (why $f$ for regression and $\hat{G}$ for classification? strange?)
* $L(G,\hat{G}(X))$ is a $K\times K$ matrix where $K=\lvert G \rvert$, with elements $l_{jk}$ giving the price to pay to misclassify an observation with true class $g_j$ to class $g_k$. 
* Elements on the diagonal of $L$ is 0, and off-diagonal elements are often $1$.

---

We would like to find $\hat{G}$ to minimize the EPE:

$$\text{EPE}=\text{E}_{G,X}[L(G,\hat{G}(X))]=\text{E}_X \text{E}_{G\mid X}[L(G,\hat{G}(X))]$$
$$=\text{E}_X \{ \sum_{k=1}^K L(g_k,\hat{G}(X))P(G=g_k \mid X=x) \} $$

---

Also here it is sufficient to minimize the loss for each value of $x$ (pointwise)

$$ \hat{G}=\text{argmin}_{g \in {\cal G}}\sum_{k=1}^K L(g_k,\hat{G}(X))P(G=g_k \mid X=x) $$

In the special case of 0-1 loss (off-diagonal elements in $L$ equal to 1) then all $k$ except the correct class gives loss $1$ with probability $P(G=g_k \mid X=x)$. Summing over the wrong classes gives the same as taking $1$ minus the conditional probability of the correct class $g$.

---

$$\hat{G}=\text{argmin}_{g \in {\cal G}} [1-P(G=g \mid X=x)]$$

$$=\text{argmax}_{g \in {\cal G}}P(G=g \mid X=x)$$

The _Bayes classifier_ classifies to the most probable class using the conditional distribution $P(G \mid X)$. The class boundaries are the _Bayes decision boundaries_ and the error rate is the _Bayes rate_.

<!-- Note: can also achieve the same result with dummy variable coding for classes and squared error. -->

## Simple example

Let assume we have $G=2$, $p=1$, and know $P(G=1 \mid X=x)=\frac{\exp(\beta_0+\beta_1 x}{1+\exp(\beta_0+\beta_1 x}$
where $\beta_0=0$ and $\beta_1=0.8$. The Bayes classifier classifies to group $1$ if $x>0$, as shown below.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
expit=function(x) return(exp(x)/(1+exp(x)))
beta0=0
beta1=0.8 
ggplot(data.frame(x = c(-6, 5)), aes(x)) + 
  xlab(expression(x)) + 
  ylab(expression(mu)) + 
  stat_function(fun = function(x) expit(beta0+beta1*x), geom = "line", colour = "red")
```

In practice we don´t know that this is true or the value for the two parameters $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$, so we estimate from data.

---

## Group discussion

1) What do we know about classification? (TMA4268 and TMA4315 mainly, or ESL ch 4.1-4.5, except 4.4.4)

* What is the difference between discrimination and classification? 
* What are the sampling vs diagnostic paradigm? Give an example of one method of each type.
* Give an example of one parametric and one non-parametric classification method.

2) Logistic regression is by many seen as the "most important method in machine learning". What do we remember about logistic regression? (Will be a very important method in Part 2.)

3) What "changes" need to be done to 2) when we have $K>2$ classes?

# Model assessment and selection

(ESL Ch 7.1-7.6,7.10-7.12)

We use a training set to estimate $\hat{f}$. 

The generalization performance of $\hat{f}$ can be evaluated from the EPE (expected prediction error) on an independent data set 

We use this for 

* Model assessment: evaluate the performance of a selected model
* Model selection: select the best model for a specific task - among a set of models

---

If we are in a _data rich situation_ we "just" divide our data into three parts, and use 

* one for training
* one for validation (model selection)
* one for testing (model assessment)

A typical split might be 50-60% training and 20-25% validation and test, but this depends on the complexity of the model to be fitted and the signal-to-noise ratio in the data.

The focus in Ch 7 of ESL is to present methods to be used in the situations where we _do not have enough data_ to rely on the training-validation-testing split.

And, even if we have enough data - what we now will learn will give us insight into much used methods for model assessment and model selection!


---

## Plan

1) Look at $\text{EPE}(x_0)$ (now called Err($x_0$) after we have estimated $f$) and how model complexity can be broken down into irreducible error, squared bias and variance (should be known from before)


2) Study EPE (Err) unconditional and conditional on the training set
3) Study optimism of the training error rate, and how in-sample error may shed light on methods for model selection (like AIC, Mallows Cp)
4) Cross-validation and .632 bootstrap estimates of EPE
5) How will we build on this in Parts 2-4?

---

## The bias-variance trade-off 

(ESL p 26 and 7.3)

Assume additive error model:
$$ Y=f(X)+\varepsilon$$
where $\text{E}(\varepsilon)=0$ and $\text{Var}(\varepsilon)=\sigma_{\varepsilon}^2$.

For the bias-variance decomposition we only consider the squared loss. Why?

In Ch 7 we use the notation Err instead of EPE (expected prediction error) that we used in Ch 2, and now we have estimated $f$ by $\hat{f}$.

Let $\text{Err}(x_0)$ be the expected prediction error of a regression fit $\hat{f}(X)$ at a (new) input value $X=x_0$. As in Ch 2 the expected value is over $(X,Y)$ for Err, and we may look at 
$$ \text{Err}=E_{x_0} \text{Err}(x_0)$$
How can we partition $\text{Err}(x_0)$ into different sources?

---

$$ \text{Err}(x_0)=\text{E}[(Y-\hat{f}(x_0))^2 \mid X=x_0]=\sigma_{\varepsilon}^2 +  \text{Var}[\hat{f}(x_0)]+[\text{Bias}(\hat{f}(x_0))]^2$$

* First term: irreducible error, $\text{Var}(\varepsilon)=\sigma^2$ and is always present unless we have measurements without error. This term cannot be reduced regardless how well our statistical model fits the data. 
* Second term: variance of the prediction at $x_0$ or the expected deviation around the mean at $x_0$. If the variance is high, there is large uncertainty associated with the prediction. 
* Third term: squared bias. The bias gives an estimate of how much the prediction differs from the true mean. If the bias is low the model gives a prediction which is close to the true value.

---

## Group activity

* Remind yourself on how this derivation was done and the meaning of each term.
* What is the role of $x_0$ here? How can you get rid of $x_0$?

---

### Derivation

If you need to refresh your memory of the bias-variance trade-off, you might also look at the exam Problem 2 [TMA4268 2018 exam](https://www.math.ntnu.no/emner/TMA4268/Exam/V2018e.pdf) with [solutions](https://www.math.ntnu.no/emner/TMA4268/Exam/e2018sol.pdf)

Also: [TMA4268](https://www.math.ntnu.no/emner/TMA4268/2019v/TMA4268overview.html) and in particular [Module 2](https://www.math.ntnu.no/emner/TMA4268/2019v/2StatLearn/2StatLearn.html)

---

The following is a derivation:

\small
\begin{align*} \text{Err}(x_0)&=\text{E}[(Y-\hat{f}(x_0))^2 \mid X=x_0]\\
&=\text{E}[Y^2 + \hat{f}(x_0)^2 - 2 Y \hat{f}(x_0)\mid X=x_0] \\
&= \text{E}[Y^2\mid X=x_0] + \text{E}[\hat{f}(x_0)^2\mid X=x_0] - \text{E}[2Y \hat{f}(x_0)\mid X=x_0]\\
&= \text{Var}[Y\mid X=x_0] + \text{E}[Y\mid X=x_0]^2 + \text{Var}[\hat{f}(x_0)\mid X=x_0] + \text{E}[\hat{f}(x_0)\mid X=x_0]^2 - 2 \text{E}[Y\mid X=x_0]\text{E}[\hat{f}(x_0)\mid X=x_0] \\
&= \text{Var}[Y\mid X=x_0]+f(x_0)^2+\text{Var}[\hat{f}(x_0)\mid X=x_0]+\text{E}[\hat{f}(x_0)\mid X=x_0]^2-2f(x_0)\text{E}[\hat{f}(x_0)\mid X=x_0]\\
&= \text{Var}[Y\mid X=x_0]+\text{Var}[\hat{f}(x_0)\mid X=x_0]+(f(x_0)-\text{E}[\hat{f}(x_0)\mid X=x_0])^2\\
&= \text{Var}(\varepsilon\mid X=x_0) +  \text{Var}[\hat{f}(x_0)\mid X=x_0]+[\text{Bias}(\hat{f}(x_0))\mid X=x_0]^2
\end{align*}
\normalsize

(For some applications also the training Xs are fixed.)
See the exercises below to study the results for $k$NN and OLS.

---

## Expected prediction error 

(ESL 7.2 and 7.4, and we are now back to a general loss function - but first have regression in mind)

If we now keep the training set fixed (we would do that in practice - since we often only have one training set):

$$ \text{Err}_{\cal T}=\text{E}[L(Y,\hat{f}(X))\mid {\cal T}]$$

as before the expected value is with respect to $(X,Y)$, but the training set is fixed - so that this is the test set error is for this specific training set ${\cal T}$.

Getting back to the unconditional version, we take expected value over ALL that is random - now including the training set 
$$ \text{Err}=\text{E}(\text{E}[L(Y,\hat{f}(X))\mid {\cal T}])=\text{E}_{\cal T} [\text{Err}_{\cal T}]$$

We want to estimate $\text{Err}_{\cal T}$, but we will soon see that it turns out that most methods estimate $\text{Err}$.

---

### Training error

(also referred to as apparent error)

For a regression problem: The training error is the average loss over the training sample:
$$\overline{\text{err}}=\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N L(y_i,\hat{f}(x_i))$$

<!--Unfortuneately the training error is  not a good estimate of the test error. -->

---

## Group discussion

Look at Figure 7.1 (with figure caption) on page 220 in the ESL book. 
The text reads that "100 simulated training sets of size 50" and that "lasso produced sequence of fits" (this means that we have different model complexities on the x-axis).

Explain what you see - in particular what are the red and blue lines and the bold lines. What can you conclude from the figure?

* Red lines=
* Bold red line=
* Blue lines=
* Bold blue line=

### Conclusion 
(from Figure 7.1)

The training error $\overline{\text{err}}$ is not a good estimate for the $\text{Err}_{\cal T}$ nor the $\text{Err}$.

---

## Loss function and training error for classification

* $X \in \Re^p$
* $G \in {\cal G}=\{1,\ldots,K\}$
* $\hat{G}(X) \in {\cal G}=\{1,\ldots,K\}$

0-1 loss with $\hat{G}(X)=\text{argmax}_k \hat{p}_k(X)$
$$L(G,\hat{G}(X))=I(G\neq \hat{G}(X))$$ 
$-2$-loglikelihood loss (why $-2$?):
$$ L(G,\hat{p}(X))=-2 \text{log} \hat{p}_G(X)$$

---

Test error (only replace $\hat{f}$ with $\hat{G}$):
$$ \text{Err}_{\cal T}=\text{E}[L(Y,\hat{G}(X))\mid {\cal T}]$$
$$ \text{Err}=\text{E}[\text{E}[L(Y,\hat{G}(X))\mid {\cal T}]]=\text{E} [\text{Err}_{\cal T}]$$

Training error (for 0-1 loss)
$$\overline{\text{err}}=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N I(g_i\neq \hat{g}(x_i))$$
Training error (for $-2$loglikelihood loss)
$$\overline{\text{err}}=-\frac{2}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \text{log}\hat{p}_{g_i}(x_i)$$
